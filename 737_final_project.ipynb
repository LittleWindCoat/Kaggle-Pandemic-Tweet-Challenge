The problem we are trying to solve is deriving meaningful insight into public opinion regarding largely controversial issues. This dataset is regarding COVID-19 and is a controversial topic on different levels whether lockdowns are placed in action, vaccines, or mask mandates. It is difficult to analyze these opinions on a surface level. Building a model that gives insight into the source of controversy in these public opinions gives public officials the ability to speak to them with greater understanding on the topic, demographics, segments, and trends.\\\n","\\\n","Sentiment analysis is a widely used method currently used to find accuracy of the application being used. Although widely used it faces challenges such as polarity, sarcasm, comparative sentences, emojis; our goal is to create a model which can learn from these issues and improve as the model is trained. We plan to use the LSTM model and Fully Connected Feedforward model because both allow for a training component to sentiment analysis for the different tweets. Both models implement the technique known as gradient descent over random forest and gradient boosting leading to successful predictions and higher accuracies.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"afeHmDrBxSdz"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"4jsGiErad-uN"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import Libraries\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd \n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer,CountVectorizer\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n","from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n","from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\n","from keras.models import Sequential\n","from keras.layers import Dense, Embedding, LSTM, SpatialDropout1D\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from keras.utils.np_utils import to_categorical\n","import re\n","from keras.layers import Dropout\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"qyJQ0v42Xe-5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1639967539708,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":15245,"user":{"displayName":"Fengyi Zhao","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"10704725620954246270"}},"outputId":"09d849ea-8b45-4d07-d3cf-c47281b1eebf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Read data from csv file\n","df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/737project/BUDT737 Files/Pandemic_NLP_train1.csv', encoding='iso-8859-1')\n","df.head(10)"],"metadata":{"id":"71Div9aDeUPT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1639970354827,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":607,"user":{"displayName":"Yudong Lu","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"08629174480504893150"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":598},"outputId":"e6fce88b-6365-476e-a385-9b696f417864"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-de18bfe6-0ad6-41e3-a135-2897f2a28d19\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>UserName</th>\n","      <th>ScreenName</th>\n","      <th>Location</th>\n","      <th>TweetAt</th>\n","      <th>OriginalTweet</th>\n","      <th>Sentiment</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>3799</td>\n","      <td>48751</td>\n","      <td>London</td>\n","      <td>16-03-2020</td>\n","      <td>@MeNyrbie @Phil_Gahan @Chrisitv https://t.co/i...</td>\n","      <td>Neutral</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>3800</td>\n","      <td>48752</td>\n","      <td>UK</td>\n","      <td>16-03-2020</td>\n","      <td>advice Talk to your neighbours family to excha...</td>\n","      <td>Positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>3801</td>\n","      <td>48753</td>\n","      <td>Vagabonds</td>\n","      <td>16-03-2020</td>\n","      <td>Coronavirus Australia: Woolworths to give elde...</td>\n","      <td>Positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>3802</td>\n","      <td>48754</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>16-03-2020</td>\n","      <td>My food stock is not the only one which is emp...</td>\n","      <td>Positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>3803</td>\n","      <td>48755</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>16-03-2020</td>\n","      <td>Me, ready to go at supermarket during the #COV...</td>\n","      <td>Extremely Negative</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>3804</td>\n","      <td>48756</td>\n","      <td>ÃT: 36.319708,-82.363649</td>\n","      <td>16-03-2020</td>\n","      <td>As news of the regionÂs first confirmed COVID...</td>\n","      <td>Positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>3805</td>\n","      <td>48757</td>\n","      <td>35.926541,-78.753267</td>\n","      <td>16-03-2020</td>\n","      <td>Cashier at grocery store was sharing his insig...</td>\n","      <td>Positive</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <td>3806</td>\n","      <td>48758</td>\n","      <td>Austria</td>\n","      <td>16-03-2020</td>\n","      <td>Was at the supermarket today.

Sentiment analysis can include unsupervised or supervised techniques. Unsupervised techniques are still existing methods used such as corpus of words associated with polarity and sentiment involved. Polarities play a role in this technique and the category is assigned based on the polarity.\n","2. Topic modeling is an NLP method which analyses topics in text. The documents that are present here are the tweets and amongst the COVID-19 there can be topics derived such as vaccine, quarantine, and mask mandates. The tweets are “documents” that include various topics; these topics can include multiple words that would be associated with the topic. This is valuable however using methods such as tokenization and tf-idf allow for the importance of words that could be in topics through the vector representation. Bi-grams and further can also pick up the importance of surrounding words and context.\n","3. WordCloud is a method of visual representation of various words in which greater prominence is given to words of higher frequency relative to others. Documents that are in the COVID-19 tweets can be analyzed for the most frequently occurring words. After filtering out common words, the importance of words can be determined through frequency because they are being represented a lot in the documents because it’s the topic rather than a common word in the language.\n","4. KNN classification of Word2Vec is another method which is used for popular representation of words by capturing the linguistic context of them. The algorithm leverages machine learning to determine word associations from a large corpus. This has application to COVID-19 tweets as we can understand the context behind popular words to get greater insight than what frequency can provide alone. Average accuracy 53.0% for tweet sentiment which is 4.02% less than the fully connected feedforward network and 21.90% less accurate than the LSTM model we created.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xWj8CVRdzUvh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Fully Connected Feedforward Network"],"metadata":{"id":"_1YltCRInQaY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Fully connected feedforward network: We apply the tf-idf on the text to receive the vector representation of the top 2000 features or sequences. \\\n","a.
